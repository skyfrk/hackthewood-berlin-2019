# Connecting the digital worlds

Hello world! As a dual student at HOMAG I was lucky enough to attend and represent the HOMAG Digital Factory at [#hackthewood2019](http://www.hackthewood.com).
The challenge I was responsible for - connecting the digital worlds - consisted of the implementation of a rather simple idea:
Connecting the tapio ecosystem with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

IFTTT or "**IF T**his **T**hen **T**hat" is an Internet of Things and automation platform.
As the name suggests it's all about very simple automations like:

* **IF** I like a music video on YouTube **THEN** add it to my Spotify library.
* **IF** my vacuum cleaner is stuck somewhere **THEN** send me a push notification.

If the tapio ecosystem was connected with IFTTT a carpenter could setup individual automations on his own. For example:

* **IF** my CNC machine set off an alarm **THEN** turn on Philips Hue lights so that a nearby employee is informed and can investigate the issue.
* **IF** I tell Amazon Alexa to turn on my edge banding machine **THEN** my edge banding machine starts up.
