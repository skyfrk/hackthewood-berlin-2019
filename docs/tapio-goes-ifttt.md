## The Idea

The idea is simple: We want to connect the tapio ecosystem with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). This enables every owner of a tapio ready machine to automate his daily business using one or more out of over 600 services.

### IFTTT

IFTTT or "**IF T**his **T**hen **T**hat" is an IoT (Internet of Things) automation platform. As the name suggests it's all about very simple connections like these:

* **IF** I like a music video on YouTube **THEN** add it to my Spotify library.
* **IF** my vacuum cleaner is stuck somewhere **THEN** send me a push notification.
* **IF** my CNC machine set off an alarm **THEN** safe the last 5 minutes of the video feed of my webcam which was monitoring the machine.

#### IFTTT Service

An IFTTT service can be any kind of digital platform like YouTube, iRobot or Wordpress which decides to hook up with IFTTT. After a successful IFTTT integration a service has to provide at least one [trigger](#ifttt-trigger) or [action](#ifttt-action).

#### IFTTT Trigger

As the name suggests IFTTT triggers can be used in [IFTTT Applets](#ifttt-applet) to invoke automations. For example the BMW Labs service provides among others following trigger:

One could also say that IFTTT triggers are external input for the IFTTT platform.

#### IFTTT Action

An IFTTT action is the counterpart to a [IFTTT trigger](#ifttt-trigger). Another example from the BMW Labs service:

![action-example](assets/action-example.png)

#### IFTTT Applet

An IFTTT applet combines a [trigger](#ifttt-trigger) with an [action](#ifttt-action) from any service. IFTTT users can create, share and configure any number of applets for free.
Example with a trigger provided by Reddit and an action provided by IFTTT:

![applet-example](assets/applet-example.png)

>Both triggers and actions provide fields which can be used to transfer data through a complete automation (eg. a link to post on Facebook).

## The Implementation Plan

Integrating tapio into IFTTT [the official way](https://platform.ifttt.com/docs) is a project on it's own and requires access to tapio internal structures and a contract between tapio and IFTTT.[ifttt-service-integration-timeline](assets/ifttt-service-integration-timeline.png)

Therefore we will use an IFTTT service called [Webhooks](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks). There is no official specification on what a Wehhook is but it's common sense to think of a Webhook as an endpoint for a http call which when called triggers something. You could also think of a Webhook being a function call over the interwebs. The IFTTT Webhook service provides a trigger which can receive http calls and an action which can send http calls:

After connecting the IFTTT Webhook service to your IFTTT account you can look up your individual URL on the [service page](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks).

### Building a demo machine

* must run a opc ua server
* cc should run
* must have input we can trigger
* must have action we can trigger

The first idea that comes to mind is to use a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). It's cheap, reliable and setup fast.

* install raspbian
* setup ssh
* install dotnet
* setup remote debugging
* setup cc
* setup motion sensor
* setup rgb led

### Building the connector


* uses webhooks
* must listen for events
  * from IFTTT
  * from tapio eventhub
  * or simple stateAPI polling
* must be able to send events to IFTTT
* must be able to send "events" (stateAPI calls) to tapio
* ngrok as tool
* auth?
