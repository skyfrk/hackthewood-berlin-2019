## The Idea

The idea is simple. We want to connect the tapio ecosystem with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

### IFTTT

IFTTT or "**IF T**his **T**hen **T**hat" is an IoT (Internet of Things) automation platform. As the name suggests it's all about very simple connections like:

* **IF** I like a music video on YouTube **THEN** add it to my Spotify library.
* **IF** my vacuum cleaner is stuck somewhere **THEN** send me a push notification.
* **IF** my CNC machine set off an alarm **THEN** safe the last 5 minutes of the video feed of my webcam which was monitoring the machine.

> You're always limited to combining **one** trigger with **one** action.
